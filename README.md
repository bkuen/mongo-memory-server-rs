# Mongo In-Memory Server for Rust unit tests

This package spins up a `MongoDB` instance programmatically from within `Rust`.
It is the counterpart to the NodeJS implementation of [nodkz](https://github.com/nodkz) 's npm package [mongodb-memory-server](https://github.com/nodkz/mongodb-memory-server).

The crate is currently in active development and is not yet ready.
